    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Historically, attempts made by others to build music genre classification systems have yielded fine but not extraordinary results. Some who used the same dataset that we used for our project, which comprises one million songs each belonging to one of ten different genres, often chose to reduce the number of genres they attempted to identify, while those who decided to work with all ten genres only achieved accuracy of 40%. The hardest part of music classification is working with time series data. The cutting edge of machine learning research is looking into more effective ways of extracting features from time series data, but is still a long way off. The most promising attempt is done by Goroshin et. al in their paper Unsupervised Feature Learning from Temporal\n",
    "Data. The problem with temporal data is that the number of features varies per each training example. This makes learning hard, and in particular makes it hard to extract information on exactly what the algorithm is using to “learn”. Algorithms that extract temporal features can be thought of as extracting a more reasonably sized set of\n",
    "features that can be learned from. To address the difficulties of working with temporal data, we used the idea of an acoustic fingerprint to extract a constant sized number of features from each song, improving our accuracy on the testing set substantially."

This dataset is a well-organized classification dataset as it consist the features of each of the song in the dataset too. The Million Song Dataset has about million songs with related metadata and audio analysis features, In this dataset, we have each song as a training example containing 34 summary features along with the genre of the track , which would be of use during training as well as testing the classifiers for predicting the genre of particular combination of features. \n",

    "- __artist_name__ : is the song’s artist name.\n",
    "- __title__ : title of the song.\n",
    "- __loudness__ : is the property of a sound that is primarily a psychological correlation of physical strength (amplitude).\n",
    "- __tempo__ : The tempo is the speed of the underlying beat for a piece of music. Tempo is measured in BPM, or Beats/Minute. The top number represents how many beats there are in a measure, and the bottom number represents the note value which makes one beat.\n",
    "- __key__ : The key of a piece is a group of pitches, or scale upon which a music composition is created.\n",
    "- __mode__ : Refers to a type of scale, coupled with a set of characteristic melodic behaviors.\n",
    "- __duration__ : song duration (in Secs).\n",
    "- __avg_timber1 - 12__ : Timbre is then a general term for the distinguishable characteristics of a tone.\n",

In addition to its computational efficiency (only n_classes classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.\n",
